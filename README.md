<p>
  Integrating independent transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility datasets permits the identification of specific gene programs in single cells. Alternatively, multiomics allows for simultaneous measurements of both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cell population. Here, we describe two workflow protocols: One employed to integrate independent transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility measurements, the other used for multimodal analysis of transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility performed in the same sample. These protocols were employed to analyze datasets obtained from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCS) induced to differentiate towards mesoderm-like, myogenic, or neurogenic phenotypes.
